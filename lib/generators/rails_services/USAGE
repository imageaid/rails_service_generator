Description:
    Creates a service class and accompanying spec file
    Destroys a service class and accompanying spec file

Example:
    rails generate rails_services:destroy Thing Model|Controller Sub-folder [opt] --instance [yes (default), no]

    This will remove:
        app/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing.rb
        spec/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing_spec.rb

    rails generate rails_services:create Thing Model|Controller Sub-folder [opt] --instance [yes (default), no]

    This will add:
        app/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing.rb
        spec/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing_spec.rb

The new `instance` argument:
    Over the last year, I have slightly altered how I structure my service classes. I've taken to using a `BaseService`
    class that is included in all services. This allows me to inherently instantiate each service (versus the old style
    which was "class-driven", if you will) but doesn't alter the signature or how a service is called and run - so updating to
    the new style should be quite easy and painless.

Description:
    Creates a service class and accompanying spec/test unit file
    Destroys a service class and accompanying spec/test unit file

Example:
    rails generate rails_services:destroy Thing Model|Controller Sub-folder [opt] --instance [yes (default), no]

    This will remove:
        app/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing.rb
        # either
        spec/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing_spec.rb
        # or
        test/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing_test.rb

    rails generate rails_services:create Thing Model|Controller Sub-folder [opt] --instance [yes (default), no]

    This will add:
        app/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing.rb
        # either
        spec/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing_spec.rb
        # or
        test/services/model|controller/[sub-folder]/thing_test.rb

The new `instance` argument:
    Over the last year, I have slightly altered how I structure my service classes. I've taken to using a `BaseService`
    class that is included in all services. This allows me to inherently instantiate each service (versus the old style of
    creating service class, which was "class-driven", if you will).
